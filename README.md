# AnimePedia

AnimePedia is a simple and interactive React application that allows users to browse and explore a curated list of anime. The app is built with React.js and leverages components like `AnimeList` and `AnimeCard` to dynamically render anime details.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Utilizes reusable components (`AnimeList`, `AnimeCard`) to manage the presentation of the anime data.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Data is managed through state in the `App` component and passed down to child components to render each animeâ€™s image and name.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
